# GD-Buildbot
The buildbot master configuration for GDevelop

This contains the files that have been modified from the default master configuration
created by buildbot. So, to use it, first create a buildbot master and then pull this
repository in it.

The passwords are stored in a separate file, named passwords.py, that is not in the
public repository.
